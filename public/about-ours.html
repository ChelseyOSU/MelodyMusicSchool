        	Melody music school is expanding its effort to enroll more and more talented students who are interested in becoming musicians in the future to perfect their music skills. The school is determined to replace their paper-based database with a modern digital database which is far more scalable and easier to maintain. A database website will record students that have been enrolled so far, the classes they have taken, the grades they have achieved in each course, as well as enrollment information. School administrations can easily query the database to answer questions.
